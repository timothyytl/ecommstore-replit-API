This is an e-commerce website built upon my previous project, simple ecom site, whereby I've integrated self-built APIs using the Node.js runtime on Replit. 
Instead of using Contentful to store and deliver data to the web application, I've utilised Replit to create, store and dynamically update products to this web application.

Purpose
-------------
The purpose of this project is to showcase my ability to build a simple full-stack web application through the introduction of a simple backend function to the web application. 
The backend development entails building my own API using Python's web framework, Replit, storing the data in the same web framework itself known as ReplitDB, and running Replit as a web server to deliver content to the web application.

Here's the link to the web application:
